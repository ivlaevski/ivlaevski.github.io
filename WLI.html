            <h1>Working from office</h1>            
            <p>As a person comfortable working from the office you can benefit from in-person conversations, meeting
                rooms and perfectly clear calendar availability.</p>
            <p>Being in the office allows you to respect others attending meetings with enabled video.</p>
            <p>Your calendar can represent your availability throughout the day and based on your seniority will help
                you to succeed with your assignments.</p>
            <p>Working for the office shall be balanced in a way to respond to your life and family goals so that all
                people close to you won't suffer from your assignment.</p>
            <p>Working from the office gives you the needed focus time for workshops and decision-making meetings. You
                can benefit from spontaneous knowledge sharing between team members. </p>
            <p>Working from the office combined with commitment related to collaboration, impact or leadership gives you
                the ability to grow in your career, skills, or experience. To fuse your work-life and coworkers with
                your personal life and friends.</p>
            <p>Working from the office combined with commitment related to family care and individual contribution gives
                you the ability to have a hard line of separation between your personal life and your work. To focus on
                assignments using the available equipment and facility.</p>
            <h2> If this is your desired state then:</h2>
            <p>Consider the possibility of taking in-person communications skills training and video-meetings conduction
                guidelines (check communication guide)</p>
            <p> Consider the guides about calendar organization and focus blockers.</p>
            <p> Consider discussing eligibility for company benefits and customized employment contracts.</p>
            <p> Review the guide about available equipment in the office. </p>

            <h1>Working from home</h1>
            <p>As a person comfortable working from home you can benefit from the convenience to remain hidden and
                flexible in time and activities.</p>
            <p> Being at home allows you to rearrange your schedule in order to fit all the dynamics of your day -
                personal and professional matters.</p>
            <p> Your work time may float around your personal preferences. But be balanced so that you can achieve both
                life and career goals.</p>
            <p> If you are able to avoid distractions at home - working from home gives you the needed focus time on
                personal tasks, focus time on work assignments, the convenience of non-video presenting and
                non-in-person meeting conversations via email and chat.</p>
            <p> Working from home combined with commitment related to collaboration, impact or leadership is hard to
                achieve as those goals are by definition in-person related communication approaches.</p>
            <p> Working from home combined with commitment related to family care and individual contribution gives you
                the ability to focus on person to person communication in and out of work.</p>
            <h2> If this is your desired state then:</h2>
            <p> Consider all options for building a safe and comfortable workspace at home by using available company
                benefits and customized employment contracts.</p>
            <p> Consider the guides about calendar information sharing and flexibility.</p>
            <p> Consider the possibility of taking training related to written communication.</p>
